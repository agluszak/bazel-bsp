[crawler]
# A list of path prefixes that are not crawled by pomgen.  Any dependency
# that starts with one of the strings returned by this method is skipped 
# and not processed (and not included in the generated pom.xml).
# These dependencies are similar to Maven's "provided" scope: if they are
# needed at runtime, it is expected that the final runtime assembly
# contains them.
# Default value: ""
# Example value: projects/protos/,
